# WeatherPy Analysis

## Written Analysis



- Observing Latitude vs Max Temperature, you will notice the temperature increases as we approach the equator an decreases as you move away from the equator. This is normal as temperature tend be warmer closer to the equator.

- Mapping the linear regression for Max Temperature you can further see the positive relationship for the southern hemisphere and negative relationship for the northern hemisphere.

- Observing Latitude vs Humidity, there is not a strong relation to latitude as the humidity is consistently above 60% whether you are in the northern or southern hemisphere.

- Similar to Humidity observation, there is not a strong relation of wind speed to latitude as the wind speeds are consistently below 20mph whether you are in the northern or southern hemisphere.

- Observing Latitude vs Cloudiness, there is no consistency or relationships at all as the data points are scattered.
